      <p> Star Citizen is an upcoming space trading and combat simulator video game for Microsoft Windows and Linux.[4][7] Star Citizen will consist of two main components:
        first-person space combat and trading with first-person shooter elements in a massively multiplayer persistent universe and customizable private servers,
        [8][9] and a branching single-player and drop-in co-operative multiplayer campaign titled Squadron 42.[7] The game is built on a modified CryEngine and will
        feature Oculus Rift support.[3][10]</p>


        <p>Both Star Citizen and Squadron 42 are set in a 30th-century Milky Way centered on the fictional United Empire of Earth (UEE), an analogue of the late Roman Empire.
        A central theme of the game is citizenship – or lack thereof – in the UEE, which must be earned through player actions such as completing a period of military service.
        It is anticipated that citizens will enjoy certain in-game benefits, like paying a reduced tax rate, but the exact details are yet to be determined.[7][11][12]</p>


        <p> strong focus will be placed on player interaction, with player behavior influencing and being influenced by a dynamic economy system.[13]
       Star Citizen is currently being developed by Chris Roberts' studio Cloud Imperium Games.[14] Roberts' previous works include games such as Wing Commander,
        Wing Commander: Privateer, Starlancer and</p>

      <p>Star Citizen aims to combine multiple video game genres, including space trading and combat simulator and first-person shooter elements,
        in a massively multiplayer online game.[11][16]</p>

        <p>Alluding to Star Citizen's online universe, Chris Roberts highlights the importance of player-driven content:
          "It's like a sandbox for everybody, and occasionally you'll sprinkle in little bits of scripted content to give a bit of character,
          but you're letting a lot of the players generate the intrigue and the drama."[17] The economy system is described as being NPC-driven,
          however, with players slowly taking over to ensure changes in game population do not disrupt the economy.[18]</p>

         <p>Roberts emphasizes his focus on immersion: "The changes in the technology in the industry will allow me to do a much more immersive experience.
            [...] It's all about that suspension of disbelief."[19]</p>


        <p>Star Citizen's space combat utilizes a Newtonian physics model to create tactical choices for the player.[19]
          Players will complete objectives to gain currency used to buy, repair and upgrade their ships or to purchase items used in trade.[20]</p>

        <p>The game's first-person shooter mechanics are reported to be inspired by games such as Rainbow Six, ARMA, Counter-Strike and Killzone.[21]</p>

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="lead">Use this document as a way to quickly start any new project.<br> All you get is this text and a mostly barebones HTML document.</p>
      <p>Star Citizen and Squadron 42 are produced in a distributed development process by Cloud Imperium Games with studios in Austin,
        Santa Monica and Wilmslow,[22][23][24] in cooperation with Behaviour Interactive, CGBot, illFonic,[25] Rmory, Turbulent, Virtuos and voidALPHA.
        [26][27] Star Citizen uses the artificial intelligence system Kythera, developed by Moon Collider.[28] Cloud Imperium Games also exchanges
        knowledge and technology with Warhorse Studios, the developers of Kingdom Come: Deliverance.[29]</p>

        <p>The development of the game started in 2011 on a modified version of the CryEngine 3 game engine, later updated to the 4th generation.
          [3] Star Citizen will support AMD's Mantle graphics API.[12] Star Citizen is being developed using a modular approach, with the first module
          (dubbed the "Hangar Module") released August 29, 2013 in order to coincide with the game's appearance at the 2013 Gamescom trade fair.[7][13]</p>

        <p>The initial alpha release of the Hangar Module allows backers of the project to explore their virtual ships from a 1st person perspective.[7]
           Subsequent updates to the Hangar Module will include the ability to add upgrades and modifications to players' ships and allow players to invite
           friends to their hangar.[30] The module system is intended to be iterative in nature, with updated version of modules being released as and when
            additional functionality and content are finalized.[17][31]</p>

            <p>The second module was released on June 4, 2014. It was officially named Arena Commander and allows backers to playtest
              the ship combat portion of the game against other players or AI opponents.[7]</p>

        <p>The first-person shooter component of the game was unveiled at PAX Australia 2014. illFonic was officially revealed as the developer of the module.
         The presented gameplay demo showcased 4-player cooperative combat on board a space station in both artificial gravity and weightlessness. Notable
         features include the synchronization of first-person and third-person animations and the separation of head and arm movement.[16][32]
        Other confirmed modules include a "Planetside" module and a singleplayer/co-op campaign dubbed Squadron 42.[33][34]
        Star Citizen will feature distinctive fictional languages for the three most prominent alien races: The Banu, the Vanduul and the Xi'An.
        In accordance with the 50 million dollar stretch goal of the game's crowdfunding campaign, the languages are individually created by linguistic specialists.[35]</p>
